### Question 1 
```
int a;
```
basic type 

```
double b;
```
basic type 

```
int c[] = {1, 2, 3};
object 

```
```
String s = "Hello World";
```
object 

integers and doubles are basic types 
integer arrays and strings are objects 

### Question 2 
A. A static method in Java refers to an unchanging allocation of a variable and is allocated when the program starts. 
B. A main method needs to be static as it needs to be accessed at any point during the program. 

### Question 3 
Program 1 will have an output of Wrong 
Program 2 will have an output of Right 

### Question 4 
No it will not change the season, as once a string is created it cannot be deleted and the reference to the object was not changed to spring. 

### Question 5 
As the contructor is missing the this keyword, the output will still be (X:0.0, Y:0.0)

### Question 6 
Encapsulation, as the private key word groups all the variables together and places it inside a container that can be used to hide information (information hiding)

### Question 7 
Java decides on the constructors based on the input that is passed. If there are 2 doubles passed then Java will used the first constructor, if a point is passed Java will used the second constructor. 

### Question 8 
Option 4 because it correctly sets the constructor to the private x and y variables by using the "this" and "get" key terms. 

### Question 9 
The output will be (0,0)

### Question 10 
The output will be (10,10)

### Question 11 
Option 4 because we can eliminate 1 and 2 because we are trying to override in custom point. Option 4 contains the "this" keyword which properly makes the constructor. 

### Question 12
Protected modifier means that it is accessible inside the class and any derived class but cannot be accessible any where else. This means that is can allow access to derived inherited class which have a "is - a" relationship. 

### Question 13 
```
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar (int n, Driver d, String make) {
    private String make;
    super(n,d); 
    this.make = make; 
}
```

### Question 14 
It will work at both points as the main method can be accessed at any point of the program. 

### Question 15
